# IPM Decisions DSS API User Guide

The DSS API is primarily being used by the IPM Decisions Platform and DSS providers. 

## Use the API test suite for understanding the APIs
In the repo folder `/postman_tests` you will find the test suite for the API. It must be run using the [Postman API Client](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/). The test suite contains requests to the API, and serve as a good guide for understanding how to make the requests. In addition, some example requests to available DSSs are provided in the sample suite in the same folder.
